3-29-2020:
-Come up with object system again (user, permissions, categories, etc)
-Map object system to entity system
-Figure out how "expand" fits in. If everything expanded, just make simple 
 CRUD interfaces for each object.
-NO special things: everything is an object with CRUD (including user registration)
-User registration objects. Make the client CREATE a registration.
-Fix "GetServiceOrCreateInstance" in entitysystem
